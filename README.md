# who am i

A raw, unfiltered personal space that goes beyond the curated facade of professional profiles and social media. This is a digital manifesto of authenticity, vulnerability, and genuine human connection.

This isn't a portfolio. It's not a resume. It's not LinkedIn. It's a space for kindred spirits who understand that authenticity is the rarest currency in our hyper-curated world.

**"I am the person who stays up too late thinking about the meaning of existence. I am the one who finds beauty in the cracks of the sidewalk and poetry in the mundane. I am raw, unfiltered, sometimes messy, always real."**
