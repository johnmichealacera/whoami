                    <p>I am not a resume. I am not a LinkedIn profile. I am not the sum of my achievements or failures.</p>
                    
                    <p>I am the person who stays up too late thinking about the meaning of existence. I am the one who finds beauty in the cracks of the sidewalk and poetry in the mundane. I am raw, unfiltered, sometimes messy, always real.</p>
                    
                    <p>This space is not for recruiters or networking. This is for kindred spirits who understand that authenticity is the rarest currency in our hyper-curated world.</p>
                    
                    <p>I believe in the power of vulnerability. I believe in showing up as your true self, even when it's uncomfortable. I believe that our imperfections make us human, and our humanity makes us beautiful.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you've stumbled here, maybe you're looking for something real too. Welcome.</p>
